# Decentralized-Exchange-with-solidity-truffle-and-ganache
This is a Repo for a simple Dex, that exchanges a dummy ERC-20 token for Ethers instantly. The token code is included in the Repo. Solidity was used to write the smart-contracts, truffle was used with chai and mocha for the testing and the local blockchain used was ganache.
